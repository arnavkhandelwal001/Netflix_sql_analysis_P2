![Netflix Banner](https://github.com/arnavkhandelwal001/Netflix_sql_analysis_P2/blob/main/Netflix_logo.png)

## 📖 Overview

This project presents a comprehensive SQL analysis of the Netflix Movies & TV Shows dataset using **PostgreSQL**. The objective is to solve real-world business problems by leveraging SQL for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

The dataset contains information about Netflix titles, including movies and TV shows, along with their directors, cast members, countries, release years, ratings, genres, durations, and descriptions.

Throughout this project, several PostgreSQL-specific functions such as `UNNEST()`, `STRING_TO_ARRAY()`, `RANK()`, `TO_DATE()`, `EXTRACT()`, and `CASE` have been used to derive meaningful business insights.
